# Serial-Device-Driver-and-Protocol-Communication
This project focuses on developing an embedded system for communication and control, employing a Microchip PIC32 microcontroller. The system utilizes UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication to interact with an external device, facilitated by the implementation of a robust communication protocol.
